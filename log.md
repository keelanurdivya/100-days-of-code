Day 1: December 1st, 2020 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Today's Progress**: Planned on how to learn programming through this month and started with control statements.Tried programming evenodd program.

**Thoughts:** I really struggled with that one program .I wasnt able to understand the logic for using else if or nested if .Will try again tomorow.

**Link to work:** [Evenodd program](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9169249/why-we-use-if-else-if-instead-of-multiple-if-block-if-the-body-is-a-return-stat)
Here i used this link to learn all about ifelse conditional statement.

Day 2: December 2nd, 2020 
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Today's Progress**: Fixed evenodd program which cleared all my doubts about conditional statements.i think i can use them proper;y in the future.

**Thoughts**: Apparently the nextint() takes empty input when it is used .So for string inout we must keep few things in mind.The scanner class used for reading inout is nt the only way.This one small basic program led to many errors and through them i learned alot.

**Link(s) to work**: The work is uploaded as a file to understand my progress.

Day 3: December 3rd,2020
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Today's Progress**: I've gone through many exercises on FreeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts** I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.

2. [Title Case a Sentence](https://www.freecodecamp.com/challenges/title-case-a-sentence)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Today's Progress**: Fixed CSS, worked on canvas functionality for the app.

**Thoughts**: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

**Link(s) to work**: [Calculator App](http://www.example.com)
